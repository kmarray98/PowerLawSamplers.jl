# PowerLawSamplers.jl - sampling random variables from discrete power law distributions

Pure Julia implementations of the "doubling up" and "inexact" samplers for sampling from discrete power law
distributions in Appendix D of Clauset, Newman, and Shalizi (2009). Also includes an doubling up sampler
for truncated discrete power law distributions, and a generator for the adjacency matrix of random
networks with power law degree distributions.
